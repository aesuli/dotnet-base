# dotnet-base

This is my repository for the Esuli.Base library, which contains some general purpose code that I use in some of my projects.

For example, it contains the implementation of:
 - heap data structure.
 - generic comparers of KeyValue objects: by key, by value, ascending, descending.
 - enumerators: of range of values, of objects from stream, or set of streams, merge of sorted enumerators.
 - serialization and storage of objects: mainly supporting sequential disk access patterns.
 - external memory sort based on merge sort algorithm.
 - ...and other snippets of useful code.

It also contains some small apps that do not reach a critical mass for a dedicated repository.
